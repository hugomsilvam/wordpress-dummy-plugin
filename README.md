# Wordpress plugin starter from scratch

Learn how to create a plugin from scratch on wordpress.

I followed [Allecaddd's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLriKzYyLb28kR_CPMz8uierDWC2y3znI2), I could have forked his [repository](https://github.com/Alecaddd/WordPressPlugin101) but he has already a lot of things done and I'm quite a beginner working with Wordpress, so I prefer to keep it thinks clean and simple 🧹😅
